## üõ† Contribution Steps

### 1. Fork the Repo
- Fork the [Texera repository](https://github.com/Texera/texera) to your own GitHub account.

### 2. Find an Existing Issue or Open an Issue
- Find an existing issue that you want to work on, or create one issue for new proposal/bug description.
- Have a discussion on the issue with Texera Committers (@Committer).
- Reach a consensus before you work on the development related to the issue.

### 3. Open a Pull Request (PR)
- Create a new branch in your fork for your contribution.
- Once you are done with the development, submit a PR from your fork to the original Texera repository.
- **Check** the option **"Allow edits from maintainers"** so that Texera Committers can make minor edits to your PR if needed.
  
#### PR Title and Commit Messages
- We require all PR titles and commit messages to follow the [Conventional Commits spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- All PR titles will be used as the **squashed commit message** when merged into the `master` branch.
- Example PR titles:
  - `feat: add a new join operator`
  - `fix(ui): prevent racing of requests`
  - `chore(deps): bump numpy to version 2.0.0`

> üí° You can use the [Conventional Commits plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13389-conventional-commit) in IntelliJ to help format commit messages correctly.

#### PR Description
Your pull request description should include:

- **Purpose** of the PR:
  - If your PR addresses an issue, use `Closes #1234` to automatically close it.
  - If it relates to an issue or another PR, reference it with `#<issue_number>` or `#<PR_number>`.
- **Summary** of changes.
- Optional **design proposal** created based on the [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ih6jLni4GgKETxOAlTOPjarlbeY5ccB2g9y1vK-Xhck/edit?usp=sharing).
- Optional **technical design diagram** or description.
- Optional **GIFs or screenshots** for UI-related changes.

#### Avoid Including Sensitive Information
Do not include any of the following in your PR:

- Local configuration files (e.g., `python_udf.conf`)
- Secrets or credentials (e.g., passwords, tokens)
- Build artifacts or binary files

### Final Steps Before Review
#### Your PR should pass scalafix check (lint) and scalafmt check. 
- To check lint, under `core` run command `sbt "scalafixAll --check"`; to fix lint issues, run `sbt scalafixAll`.
- To check format, under `core` run command `sbt scalafmtCheckAll`; to fix format, run `sbt scalafmtAll`. 
- When you need to execute both, scalafmt is supposed to be executed after scalafix.
#### Testing the backend
1. The test framework is `scalatest`, for the amber engine, tests are located under `core/amber/src/test`; for `WorkflowCompilingService`, tests are located under `core/workflow-compiling-service`. You can find unit tests and e2e tests.
2. To execute it, navigate to `core` directory in the command line and execute `sbt test`.
3. If using IntelliJ to execute the test cases please make sure to be at the correct working directory.
* For the amber engine's tests, the working directory should be `core/amber`
* For the other services' tests, the working directory should be `core`
#### Testing the frontend 
Before merging your code to the master branch, you need to pass the existing unit tests first.
1. Open a command line. Navigate to the `core/gui` directory.
2. Start the test:
```
ng test --watch=false
```
3. Wait for some time and the test will get started.
You should also write some unit tests to cover your code. When others need to change your code, they will have to pass these unit tests so that you can keep your features safe.
The unit tests should be written inside `.spec.ts` file.
4. Run the following command to fix the formatting of the frontend code.
```
yarn format:fix
```

### 4. PR Review
- [ ] Ask a Texera Committer (by commenting on the PR) to triage your PR, i.e., request a reviewer, and assign the PR to you.
- [ ] Add appropriate labels such as `fix`, `enhancement`, `docs`, etc.
- [ ] Ensure that all CI checks pass (see [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Texera/texera/actions)).
- [ ] Fully test your changes locally.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è If your PR is not ready for review, please mark it as a draft. You can change it to ‚ÄúReady for review‚Äù when it is complete.

### 5. After PR Approval
- [ ] Wait for a Texera Committer, usually the reviewer, to merge the PR once it is approved.
- [ ] Close the related issue once the PR is merged (if it is not automatically closed).
